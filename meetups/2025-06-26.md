## Talk-1: Building Multi-Agentic AI Architecture on Langflow 

by **Melissa Herrera**, Developer Relations Engineer at DataStax (now IBM) on the Langflow team


This talk shows you how to build multi-agent workflows in Langflow that actually work together seamlessly. I'll walk through orchestrating agents, integrating real-time data with tools like Composio and Astra DB, and share the hard-learned lessons / common pitfalls from building these systems.

## Talk 2: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Deep Dive 

by **Ramnivas Laddad** of Exograph

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful--but only when they have access to the right context. While techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) help bridge this gap, they remain limited in the types of questions they can answer and tasks they can perform. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by providing an open, lightweight standard that connects AI models to real-time information and external tools. In this session, you'll get a hands-on introduction to MCP: how it works, how it seamlessly integrates LLMs with external systems, and how it fits into the broader AI tooling ecosystem. We'll explore working examples of MCP servers, watch a model interact with them to perform meaningful tasks, and get a preview of upcoming changes to the MCP specification--making this session ideal for developers aiming to build more capable, context-aware, and responsive AI applications.
